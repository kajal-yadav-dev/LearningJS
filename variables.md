Variable is a identifier/container for storing values in memory. 
features of variable.
    variable will have name.
    There are multiple types of variable in javascript.
        (Number, String, Objects, Boolean, Symbol, Array)
    We can assign a value in a variable using equal(=) operator. 
    for Examples.
    
    var name = 'Kajal';  // its string value which is stored in name
    var number = 10;  //  its number value which is stored in variable name number.
    var istrue = ture // is it is boolean which is tored in in the variable name isTrue.
    var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]; // it is array 
    var person = { 
                    name: 'Kajal', 
                    age: 21, 
                    proffesion: 'developer'
                 };
                 
   Note: - It is not necesary to assign a value while declaring a variable.
   when we declar a variable and don't assgin a value by default undefined is the value of that variable. 
   once we assin another value that overrides the prvious one. 
   for example 
   
   var name; - here by default name has undefined value
   name = 'kajal'; - now name has new value 'kajal' which overrides the undefined.
